Processes file                            Executes file

(LEXER -> PARSER -> SEMANTIC-ANALYZER) -> EXECUTOR



including byproducts:
src -> lexer -> tokens -> parser -> AST -> SEMANTIC-ANALYZER -> action-tree -> executor



LEXER 
    Converts source code into tokens that can be individually processed

PARSER
    Organizes tokens into an AST for later processing - groups tokens based on operator binding, and seperators

SEMANTIC-ANALYZER
    Completes details for AST

EXECUTOR
    Something that executes an action tree in some form - interpreter, transpiler, compiler, etc



Made so each stage can be swaped with another version of itself - mostly the executor
